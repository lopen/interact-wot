# interact-wot

> Contains spoilers for the entire Wheel of Time series!

interact-wot is an interactive map of the Westlands in the Third Age, from the Wheel of Time series.

The Python application essentially generates a Folium map with markers highlighting points of interest along with descriptions of locations, saves it into an html file which can then be displayed on a webserver.

**NOTE:** *The map was created by [Dimension Door](https://linktr.ee/dimensiondoormaps) and the information for the markers were found on the [WoT Fandom Wiki](https://wot.fandom.com/wiki/).*

## Still work in progress

Still developing the app, the basics are down, now the markers.json file has to be filled with information and the coordinates for the different locations have to be found so the map can generate the markers in the right place with the right information. See the [issues](https://github.com/lopen/interact-wot/issues) for what's to come.
